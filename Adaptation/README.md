# Instruction for training Adaptation Network
pytorch 0.3.1<br>
torchvision 0.2.0<br>
python 3.6.0<br>
numpy 1.15.4<br>

OR you can just run the codes for higher version pytorch, the performances should be close.<br>

If you have gone to ../Correction and run python generate_file_for_adaptation.py, just run the following code for training Adaptation Network
```shell
sh scripts/train.sh
```
